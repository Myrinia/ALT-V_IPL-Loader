# ALT-V IPL-Loader
IPL Loader to load IPL’s as soon as Player is in range of the IPL Coordinates.

This also fixes, IPL’s not showing on reconnect in debug mode.

## Features
Loader works 100% Clientside as a standalone, but I added a little Serverside Script to be able to add IPL's at runtime.
Though - I think it is most likely not needed at runtime.

All IPL’s provided by default are included:

Cayo Perico
Is not added, as it is most likely implemented by most servers as in the Docs from here:
